One example was the domestication of plants of tremendous economic value that were grown in species-rich areas inhabited by sophisticated ancient civilizations. This process was key in the development of agriculture and gave rise to hubs of origin of major crops such as maize, yucca, potatoes, peanuts, beans, squash, tomatoes, cacao, quinoa and others.",10,False,"[15, 2]",False,True
60d8647,"Overall, these findings signal synergies across policy objectives, i.e. that reforms aimed at encouraging exports among domestic firms could boost efficiency and equity. This finding could reflect FDI-induced demand for unskilled labour and associated employment creation, and it would suggest that policy reforms aimed at easing barriers to entry for foreign firms could serve both the efficiency and equity objectives. By contrast, there is some evidence of negative effects on household incomes of the lower-middle class and the poor.",10,True,"[8, 10]",True,True

The IMF’s energy index saw the sharpest decline between 2014 and 2015, at 44.9 per cent (Figure 1.5). The continued decline in commodity prices indicates an end to the commodity supercycle that commenced in the early 2000s. The oil price fall is expected to yield a windfall for the majority of Commonwealth small states, which are net importers of oil, although in general the pass-through to retail prices has been relatively limited thus far, reflecting short-term price rigidities and exchange rate fluctuations.",10,False,"[7, 8]",False,True
77a9c14,"The levels of inequality in some emerging-economy countries of the region are also approaching that of Latin American countries. However, a transition towards more proactive fiscal policies to adjust income distribution and an enhanced role of progressive direct taxes in particular, as observed in Latin America, has yet to happen. For the more advanced developing countries of the region, the progress achieved in Latin American countries since the 2000s is not beyond reach. In 2015 total tax revenue averaged 16.4 per cent of GDP in the region, compared to developing country average of 20.2 per cent and developed country average of 25.1 per cent.110 This regional average conceals the vast differences between countries.",10,True,[10],True,True
